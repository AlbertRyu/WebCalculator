# Web Calculator

A simple web calculator provides original calculator experience.

## Description

This is the final project of TheOdinsProject, which will test our HTML, CSS and Javascript knowledge to the utmost. I am very much looking forward to it. It will be fun and assumably time costy.

## Road Map

Maybe it deserves a simple roadmap.

1. <s> Basic Function in Javascript</s>
2. <s> HTML interface</s>
3. <s> CSS polish </s>
4. <s> User Logic in Javascript</s>
6. <s> Add Favicon </s>
5. Keyboard Surpport
6. Sound Effect?
7. ...

## User Logic

1. When User press =, do the calculation, store the result in number 1.
2. When user press a second operator while one already exist, if number 2 exist, do the operate, and put it in the operator position, otherwise, replace the operator.
